## **FINAL REPORT** 
<hr


Data provided for this study are quite recent, belonging mainly to 2016, and some of them, to 2017. For the purpose of this study I analysed â€¦. main issues:
       
    1. To analyse which countries were more frequently animal importers and which were mainly importers.
    2. To investigate the purpose of the import and export of exotic animals (and for this, I excluded all data related to plants).
    3. Also I was interested in knowing the source, the origin of these animals to be traded, so I also analysed these data.
    4. Of course I was interested on the type of animals that were more frequently traded in 2016-2017, and therefore I selected these data to be analysed.
The rest of the information provided by CITES was discarded for this study, however, although original data were very complete, basic information regarding the order (i.e,(explanation)) and the phylum (i.e,(explanation)) of the animals was not provided. 
In order to include some educational additional information, I cleaned and sorted the original dataset and I used NOMBRE DE LA API to obtain additional information of the already filtered and cleaned data to avoid repetitive requests that would not provide further information.
